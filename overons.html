		<h1>About Us</h1>
		<p>It all started with a little corner of a home—a spot filled with warmth, soft lighting, and the comforting scent
			of fresh pine and blooming plants. That corner became the heart of a vision: to bring cozy, welcoming spaces
			into every home. Snug & Spruce was born out of a love for creating havens where life feels a little slower, a
			little simpler, and infinitely more comfortable.</p>
		<br>
		<p> Our founder wanted to combine timeless furniture, natural greenery, and the flickering charm of candles to
			inspire that feeling of "home." Carefully curated, every piece in our collection tells a story of warmth and
			charm, designed to transform any room into a sanctuary. Whether you're curling up with a book or hosting loved
			ones, Snug & Spruce provides the finishing touches that make a house a home.</p>
		<br>
		<p> Rooted in quality and sustainability, we believe in pieces that last—crafted with care and a connection to
			nature. Snug & Spruce invites you to find your perfect cozy corner, one thoughtful item at a time.</p>
